// The things database is broken into the following parts
// with the following responsibilities:

// The `core` module contains the `ThingDb` struct. It is a container for
// `HubThing`s , which can be indexed by either Serial Number (primary key),
// or Geeny Thing UUID (secondary key)
mod core;

// The `hub_thing` module contains the `HubThing` struct. This container holds
// the current state of the device (e.g., 'needs to gather metadata', 'active device'),
// as well as the channels used to send data hub -> cloud and cloud -> hub
mod hub_thing;

// The `runner` module is a manually pumped event loop. It periodically prompts
// the `ThingDb` to trigger each of its `HubThing`s to perform any necessary actions,
// such as processing queued messages, or to update state if new information is available
mod runner;

/// The `state` module contains the inner state types used by `HubThing`s.
/// State transition logic occurs here
mod state;
